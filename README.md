# HandwrittenDigitRecognition

## About the data
The here provided dataset consists of handwritten digits. The test data set was created as part of the publication "Investigations on real-time image recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks on industrial controllers" for the SOHOMA22 conference.
The dataset was created using a flexible production system. A video of the production system and how the images are captured can be seen in [1]. The process of image acquisition and image processing is described in more detail in [2].

## About the networks
In addition to the recorded test data, the networks used in the paper are also provided. Only the data from the MNIST dataset [3] has been used for training the networks. The trained networks are also available in the form of an ONNX file. The structure of networks C1, C2, C3 and M7 has been taken from the paper [4].

## About the production system
The shown robotic cell is a demonstrator to investigate different approaches for an individualized manufacturing. The demonstrator is installed at the University of Applied Sciences Kiel, where it is used in the laboratory for automation technology.
